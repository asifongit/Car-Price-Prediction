# Car-Price-Prediction
# Description
This project utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to predict the prices of used cars using datasets from PakWheels. By leveraging libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Plotly, it provides insights through interactive visualizations and predicts car prices based on various attributes such as model, manufacturer, and mileage. Preprocessing methods are included to handle missing data and outliers, enhancing the accuracy of predictions.

# Introduction.
The goal of this project is to apply machine learning to accurately predict used car prices in Pakistan. Using comprehensive datasets from PakWheels, the project achieves an impressive predictive accuracy of 96%.

# Objectives
Design a predictive model to estimate used car prices.
Analyze factors influencing car valuations.
Provide a user-friendly interface for car price estimations.
Data Preprocessing
Data cleaning and feature engineering steps are performed to ensure data integrity and enhance predictive efficacy. This includes handling missing values and extracting relevant features.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Visualizations are created to explore data distributions and correlations between attributes and car prices.

# Modeling
The XGBoost Regressor is used to capture nonlinear relationships between features and car prices. The model is evaluated using R2 scores and cross-validation to ensure robustness.

# Results
The model demonstrates high predictive accuracy. A Streamlit application allows users to input car attributes and get real-time price predictions.

# Conclusions and Recommendations
The project successfully predicts used car prices with high accuracy. Future work includes expanding the dataset, exploring ensemble methods, and analyzing feature importance.
